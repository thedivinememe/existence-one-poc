# Existence One (!1) Proof of Concept

**A philosophical and mathematical exploration of binary assumptions in computing.**

This project investigates what happens when we reinterpret binary 0 as !1 (not-one)â€”treating zero not as an independent primitive but as the active negation of existence (1). Through mathematical proofs and computational demonstrations, we explore how this philosophical shift reveals hidden assumptions in our digital infrastructure.

## What This Project Is

- **A Thought Experiment**: Exploring alternative foundations for binary logic
- **A Mathematical Investigation**: Demonstrating how different axioms lead to different computational properties  
- **A Research Tool**: Providing concrete implementations to study alternative semantics
- **An Educational Resource**: Helping understand the philosophical assumptions underlying computing

## What This Project Is NOT

- **Not an Immediate Exploit**: Current systems remain secure
- **Not a Practical Attack**: The vulnerabilities exist within the theoretical framework, not in deployed systems
- **Not Breaking Bitcoin Today**: Mining advantages only manifest if systems adopted !1 semantics

## Quick Demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# See how binary operations change under !1 semantics
python run.py basic-demo

# Explore theoretical Bitcoin mining implications
python run.py theoretical-mining

# Run the full demonstration suite
python run.py full-demo
