Existence One Proof of Concept

This package demonstrates how reinterpreting binary 0 as !1 (not-one) fundamentally
breaks modern cryptography and digital infrastructure.

Core concept: Only 1 (existence) is a true primitive; 0 is actually !1 (the negation of existence),
creating fundamental asymmetries that break cryptographic assumptions.
